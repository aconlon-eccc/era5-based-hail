Judged through a damage survey two days later to be a strong F2 tornado. The damage survey conducted by members of the PASPC-Winnipeg on Monday, July 4 turned up the following: a poorly-anchored mobile home was destroyed, a steel-reinforced machine shed (40'x80'x30') that had been bolted into a cement foundation was also destroyed, trees 12 to 18 inches in diameter were snapped 10 to 20 feet off the ground, several sheds/barns flattened (debris left laying beside foundation), empty grain bins tossed 100's of yards away (that were bolted into the ground), insulation left hanging in the trees, mud splattered on the sides of homes, at least 10 power poles knocked over, a school bus was pushed 30 feet backward over a crabapple tree,several deceased poultry, a 1""x8"" piece of wood was embedded half-in and half-out of a house and the safety glass on the same house was shattered but not broken by flying debris. Most of the tops of the trees were no where to be found, presumably strewn miles away from the trunks still in the ground. The width of the damage path was twice measured to be 1.3 km.

Reading just /Summary of damage in the Markerville area on Aug 10: Damage was obs to start around the Raven area ~50km WSW of Red Deer and continued NE of Red Deer to the Forestburg area. Main damage seems to have been caused by the combination of loonie to Golf ball size hail and winds in excess of 100km/h.In the town of Markerville and surrounding area is where most damage was caused.

YQF reported 20mm hail and winds gusting up to 65kts. Pictures show that there accumulations of >5cm.Also within the town of Springbrook is the Air Cadet summer training camp.

Numerous reports of large trees being blown over in the area west of Red Deer but all seemed to be pointing in the same general direction (east).

Emergency crews responded to a bizarre roof collapse in the citys northeast. Witnesses say they heard a huge ""whooshing"" noise and then the sound of flying debris slamming and banging around. The gust of wind was so strong it moved a massive heating unit on the roof of a business called Alberta Fire and Flood Restoration, ripping a hole in its roof. The office below was exposed and ceiling tiles got sucked up through that hole. The wind blew open doors on the building. It also smashed out the windows of several cars in the parking lot. Some people are speculating this was a small tornado, but that is not confirmed. Another area hit hard was Inglewood where the storm ripped the tops off trees and sent them crashing into fences. There are also smashed windows and damaged homes in the area."" ***Time estimated from radar. Duration: 0.50 Hours.

&quot;Witnesses describe heavy rain and golf-ball sized hail accompanying intense wind, most indicators blown from west though some trees down from south at northern edge of microburst, time given as 5-6pm - radar used to refine timing, worst damage at Albert's Marina (which was visited) but similar damage also occurred at South Bay Harbour Marina where ~20 boats were damaged by a collapsed boathouse structure there. Heavy tree damage also at River Drive off Queensville Sideroad and at Balmoral Heights in Queensville at the eastern edge of the microburst.

It's a bit hard to guess, but some of the larger hailstones appear to be approaching 2 cm in diameter, if not quarter size (2.4cm) perhaps, or even larger perhaps. The camera man doesn't do a good job focusing on the biggest stones that fall, nor do they pick those big stones up. 

Time is estimated from XTI RADAR via Weatheroffice...a few cells went through Cochrane but this appears to be the worst one of the day.

They are located at Fawcett Lake East resort. 5 or 6 residents supposedly saw a funnel cloud, no pictures were received of said funnel cloud. Damage reports included multiple fallen trees - mostly uprooted though some were snapped. The snapped trees were healthy poplars and some spruce trees. Curtis noted that the damage appeared to follow a definite path. Other damage reports included sheds destroyed, trailer roofs ripped off, tin roofs carried about a kilometer, trailers moved or tipped, and a shed lofted and carried about 150 feet. One family was inside one of the trailers that was tipped and a child was injured - very minor though, no hospital visit needed. Only pea sized hail was reported with the storm. Trees fell in different directions apparently, and much damage to sheds and trailers came from trees falling on top of them. Some RV trailers were reported to have lifted and moved slightly. As of now, it is being recorded as POSSIBLE tornado, but not confirmed. Meteorological circumstances were not indicative of a tornado at the time, however a landspout could be possible.

The call was short and not much information was received as the officer was driving with his sirens on and said he could not talk much. There was a significant couplet on radar and tornado warnings were issued before this call was received. The couplets lasted for several scans on radar. Approximately 15 minutes after the RCMP phone call, a video was posted on Facebook from Amanda Quinney of a definite, large rotating funnel that appeared to touch the ground multiple times. The video caption said that she was near Beaver Lake. An attempt has been made to contact Amanda to try and receive more information. Later, the same RCMP officer - Srgt Clarke - called back and reported that there was toonie sized hail that damaged police vehicles and covered the Lac La Biche area. He also clarified that he did not actually see the funnel touch down, but that there was a definite funnel - tree coverage is likely to blame for him not seeing contact. At the moment, no reports of damage have been received, and more information is being sought for. Amanda Quinney called the office to report more information at about 3:30 local time on June 29th. She said she was at Beaver Lake on the Powow grounds and from the field at the grounds she could see it perfectly. She was looking south-southeast. The tornado touched down at about 4:25pm and lasted about 2 minutes (roughly the duration of her video), she could see clear funnel to ground contact. About a minute after she stopped recording it touched down again and was clearly visible on the ground for about another minute. Another funnel much closer to the Powow grounds was reported to come extremely close to touching down as well and had clear rotation but did not touch down. No damage was reported by Amanda, she couldn't see damage and hadn't heard of any. She is going to send more pictures via email to the student and the storm account.

Irregular shaped hail, estimated to have average diameter of ~3cm. Photo was on facebook, saved in excel file but link appears to be broken now unfortunately. Hail fell at County Road 10 near 4th concession. There was some photos of wind driven hail appearing to damage siding on at least one house, with some holes suggesting larger than 3cm hail was possible...however, no photo evidence, so will keep at 3cm for now.

I am sending you an image captured yesterday Jun 10 2020 from Windsor of a hail fall, that was supplied to me by a local resident.  The hailstorm was reported to have occurred in the time period 5:39 to 5:49.  I am filing this report as to me the hail size seems larger than normal for this area.  Perhaps this may be of interest to your Severe Weather desk.

Event: hail fall with hail sizes from 1/4&quot; to 3&quot;, Windsor, ON. June 10 2020
Location of fall: 83° 01’ W and 42° 19’ N
Time: approximately between 5:39pm and 5:49PM
     The observer reported:

One video of someone near Rafferty Dam clearly shows a well-defined funnel with ground circulation over what looks to be McDonald Lake. The environment looked to support non-supercell tornadoes, however the storm looked to have supercellular features in some pictures. The forecasters leaned towards calling it a supercell tornado since the best shear was in this area and it may have been just enough to support a supercell. People on twitter reported one funnel cloud that lasted until about 23:05Z that did not touch down. Afterwards, there was another funnel after the first one lifted that did touch down (this tornado). Based on the reports and radar, it is estimated that the tornado touched down at ~23:10. Toonie-sized hail was also reported near Estevan at 23:18Z.
